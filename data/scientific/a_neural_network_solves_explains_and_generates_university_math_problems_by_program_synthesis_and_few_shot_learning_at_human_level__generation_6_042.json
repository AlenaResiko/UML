What is the expected number of tosses?   & \nMIT students sometimes delay laundry for a few days. Assume all random values described below are mutually independent. A relaxed student rolls a fair, 6-sided die in the morning. If he rolls a 1, then he does his laundry immediately (with zero days of delay). Otherwise, he delays for one day and repeats the experiment the following morning. Let R be the number of days a relaxed student delays laundry. What is Ex (R)? \n\n\\\\\n\\hline\n2 & Suppose that a graph G is a tree. Prove that G is a DAG.   & \nGive a minimal example of a graph in which every vertex is adjacent to at least one other vertex, but the graph is not connected.\n\n\\\\\n\\hline\n3 & A student is taking a test consisting of n multiple-choice questions. Each question has five possible answers, and only one of them is correct. The student knows that the probability that any particular question is answered correctly is 1/5. Let X be the number of questions answered correctly by the student. What is E(X)?   & \nMIT students sometimes delay laundry for a few days. Assume all random values described below are mutually independent. A busy student must complete 3 problem sets before doing laundry. Each problem set requires 1 day with probability 2/3 and 2 days with probability 1/3. Let B be the number of days a busy student delays laundry.

Suppose that Sayan\u2019s probability of levitating is 1/6, Jelani\u2019s chance of becoming president is 1/4, and the success of one does not alter the other\u2019s chances. If neither of them succeeds, what is the probability that both of them learn to levitate? & \nOutside of their humdrum duties as 6.042 TAs, Sayan is trying to learn to levitate using only intense concentration and Jelani is launching a \u201cNelson 2008\u201d presidential campaign.
