I am. \nAlthough it is not the focus of our work, we generate text summaries from the subgraphs selected in the node selection phase with combined merging. We trained BART on the linearized AMR for the selected subgraph and the associated text summaries, and used this model to generate a text summary for each document. We provide examples of a few such summaries in \\autoref{tab:generated}.\n\n\\begin{table*}[]\n   \\centering\n   \\begin{tabular}{p{7cm}|p{7cm}}\n   \\toprule\n   Gold summary & Generated summary output\\\\\n   \\midrule\n   Afghanistan's counter-narcotic police have confiscated 1.2 metric tons (1.3 tons) of opium during a raid. In 2007 Afghanistan accounted for 93 percent of the world's opium supply. & Afghanistan's Interior Ministry announced the confiscation of more than a ton of opium from a drug trafficker and the detention of a drug smuggler in the southernmost province of Helmand. The drug was smuggled into Afghanistan from Pakistan.\\\\ \\hline\n   Russia proposes cooperation with India and China to increase security around Afghanistan to block drug supplies. Afghanistan is 1 of the world's major opium producers and supplies Western markets through transit countries such as Russia. & Russia's Foreign Minister Lavrov stated that the Russian government will increase security at the borders with Afghanistan and Tajikistan in order to decrease the flow of illegal drugs from Afghanistan to the world market. The Russian government stated that Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium and the largest supplier of heroin to Russia.\\\\ \\hline\n   Russian Federation President Dmitry Medvedev promised on May 15, 2008 to provide funding for Russia's nuclear missile program. & Russian President Dmitry Medvedev made his first public appearance since being sworn in as the new President of the Russian Federation on November 9, 2008. The Russian President stated that the Russian military is ready to respond to any threat from the West.\\\\ \\hline\n   \\bottomrule\n   \\end{tabular}\n   \\caption{Sample generated summary output from BART given our selected content as input.}\n   \\label{tab:generated}\n\\end{table*}",
