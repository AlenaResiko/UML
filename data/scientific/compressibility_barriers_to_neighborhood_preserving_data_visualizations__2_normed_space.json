Practitioners are usually interested in producing faithful data visualizations into more structured spaces. For instance, it is often desirable to work with data in a normed space due to the ability to add and scale the points as vectors. The significance of the norm structure is not just mathematical convenience but also its direct interpretability for data visualization: we tend to think in terms of normed (especially Euclidean) space because it obeys similar principles as physical space.\nto their rich algebraic structure (including having the ability to add and scale vectors) and the visual interpretability that follows from this structure.\nThis motivates us to study $\\alpha$-preservation into such spaces. We find that this restriction comes at a steep cost in terms of the embedding dimension.\n\n\\textcolor{red}{long-winded intro}\n\n\\todo[inline]{In the above, we should maybe make a more direct connection to data visualization where we want the distance between points in the embedding to correspond to the distances we as humans see between them which is inherently $\\ell_2$. Moreover, this justifies why we give special attention to $\\ell_2$ in the ensuing section.}\n\n\n\\subsection{Lower Bounds}\n\nTypically\nGeneral metric spaces turn out to be very flexible for the purposes of \\(\\alpha\\)-preservation, as \\(\\Theta(\\log(n))\\) is typically both necessary and sufficient. \nData visualization is typically performed in normed spaces such as Euclidean space, where operations like scaling and shifting are well-defined. \n\\textcolor{red}{say something about volume argument}\n\nThe normed structure of the target embedding enables us to use the volume argument. The sheer plentitude of graphs in $\\Gn$ need to be embedded in a limited space, thus packing gives the result. \n\nIt turns out that \\((\\alpha\\geq 1)\\)-preservation (that is neighborhood \\emph{recoverability}) in normed spaces is exponentially harder than it is for general metrics: an overwhelming fraction of graphs in $\\Gn$ require dimension that scales \\textit{linearly} in \\(n\\), in contrast to the   a\\textcolor{red}{/the?} \nlogarithmic scaling in the case of general metrics (cf.\\ Theorem \\ref{thm:NeighborPreservingMain}).\n\nthese properties of normed space change the preservation dimension landscape dramatically. We find that a overwhelming fraction \\todo{hmmm? constant??} of general graphs require \\(\\Theta(n)\\) dimensions to be preserved in normed space.\n\n\n\n\\begin{restatable}{theorem}\n{polyMain}\n\\label{thm:polyMain}\nLet $\\mathbb{L}$ be the collection of all normed spaces. \nWe have the following.\n\\begin{enumerate}[label(\\roman*)]\n   \\item \\textbf{(General normed spaces)} Let $\\mathbb{L}$ be the collection of all normed spaces.

In particular, one can show that an $O(k^2 \\log n)$-dimensional $\\ell_2$ embedding exists for all such graphs (see Proposition \\ref{prop:kregularUpperBound}) which nearly matches the lower bounds of Theorem \\ref{thm:NeighborPreservingMain}(ii). \n\\item Similarly one cannot hope for an \\(\\Omega(n)\\) bound for the case when $\\alpha <1$. It turns out that \\emph{all} graphs $G\\in\\Gn$ can be $(\\alpha<1)$-preserved in $\\ell_\\infty^d$ for $d   O(\\log |P(G)|)   O(\\log n)$ (see Proposition \\ref{prop:linf_ub}).\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe proof of incompressibility for general normed spaces proceeds via an elegant application of the volume argument. utilizes an elegant application of the volume argument.\nSpecifically, the vector space structure of normed spaces enables us to superimpose the sheer plenitude of low-diameter graphs in a small enough region. Noting that disparate graphs (with disparate neighborhood structures) require disparate neighborhood-preserving embeddings in the space, one must require the target dimension to scale with $n$ to accommodate these embeddings. Formal details are provided in Appendix \\ref{app:proof_normed_spaces}.\n\nThe highly regular structure of the Euclidean space enables us to extend our lower bound to the $\\alpha1$ case in $\\ell_2$. This requires an alternate analysis. In particular, we leverage the fact that since the (squared) $2$-norm distances can be represented by a (quadratic) polynomial, any graph can be distinctly recognized from an $(\\alpha1)$-preserving embedding in $\\ell_2$ by a series of polynomial threshold tests. By a theorem due to \\citet{WarrensPoly}, we know that the polynomial threshold tests are expressive enough to distinguish the graphs only if the embedding dimension is $\\Omega(n)$, yielding the desired extension.\\footnote{This method of proof extends to other $p$-norms (for $p$ even), and may be of independent interest.}   This method of proof also extends to other even $p$-norms and was first introduced by \\cite{reiterman1989embeddings} who showed that for $1-\\frac{1}{n}$ fraction of $\\Gn$, $\\dim_{(\\alpha1)}(G, \\ell_2) \\geq \\frac{n}{15}-1$. \nFormal details are provided in Appendix \\ref{app:proof_normed_spaces}.\n\nThe specialization to \\(p\\)-norms requires an alternate analysis. \nWe translate the geometric problem of graph preservability into a combinatorial problem. Specifically we show a set of $n \\choose 2$ degree $p$-polynomials over $nd$ variables that can \\emph{distinguish} all   graphs uniquely that $(\\alpha\\geq1)$-embedded in $\\ell_p^d$ ($p$ even) only when the embedding dimension $d$ is sufficiently large. \\textcolor{red}{[need to rephrase; it is unclear that there is no alternative (completely different from polynomials) route that can potentially work...]}.

Specifically:\n\\todo{why UB after LB?}\nFirst we show that, for all \\(\\alpha\\), we can \\(\\alpha\\)-preserve \\(\\Gn\\) in \\(\\ell_\\infty^{n}\\).\n\n\\begin{observation}\\label{prop:frechetEmbedding}\n   For all \\(\\alpha\\in (0,2)\\) and   \\(G\\in \\Gn\\), we have \\(\\dim_\\alpha(G, \\ell_\\infty) \\leq \\lceil \\log_2(3)\\cdot   (n-1) \\rceil   O(n)\\).\n\\end{observation}\n\\begin{proof}\nFr\u00e9chet's construction (see e.g.\\ \\citet{matousek2013lectures}) yields   an isometric embedding of the shortest path metric of \\(G\\) into $\\ell_\\infty^n$. This also constitutes an $(\\alpha<2)$-preservation. Translating into doubling dimension, the result is proved.\nconsider the $n$-point metric induced on the vertices of $G$ defined as follows\\todo{Can this not be done by embedding the standard metric?}\n$$\\rho(v,v') : \\begin{cases}\n0 & vv'\\\\\n1 & v\\sim_G v' \\\\\n2 & v \\nsim_G v'\\end{cases}$$\n\nlet gives us an \\(n\\)-point metric \\(\\X_G\\) for each \\(G\\in \\Gn\\). Then apply the Fr\u00e9chet embedding to each \\(\\X_G\\) into \\(\\ell_\\infty^n\\). This is an isometric embedding, so each graph is still preserved. Furthermore, \\(\\ell_\\infty^n\\) clearly has doubling dimension \\(O(n)\\). \n\\end{proof}\n\nThis trivial result can be refined as follows. \n\\textcolor{red}{update: to get rid of annoying constant, Slight of notation: just multipy by \\(\\log_2 5 \\) to get the doubling dimension bound.}\n\\begin{proposition}\n\\label{prop:linf_ub}\n   For all $G\\in \\Gn$,\n   $$\n   \\dim_\\alpha(G,\\ell_\\infty) \\leq \\left \\{\n   \\begin{array}{ll}\n   \\lceil\\log_2(3)\\Big\\lceil \\frac{ \\log |P(G)|}{\\log \\lceil 1/\\alpha\\rceil}\\Big\\rceil \\Big\\rceil O\\Big(\\frac{\\log |P(G)|}{ \\log\\lceil1/\\alpha\\rceil}\\Big) & \\alpha \\in (0,1) \\vspace{0.05in}\\\\\n   \\lceil \\log_2(3) \\cdot |C(G)| \\rceil   O(|C(G)|) & \\alpha \\in [1,2)\n   \\end{array} \n   \\right. .$$\n   \\begin{enumerate}[label(\\roman*)]\n   \\item For any $\\alpha\\in (0,1)$ we have $\\dim_\\alpha(G,\\ell_\\infty)   O\\Big(\\frac{\\log |P(G)|}{\\lceil \\log(1/\\alpha) \\rceil}\\Big)$.\n   \\item For any $\\alpha\\in [1,2)$ we have $\\dim_\\alpha(G,\\ell_\\infty)   O\\Big(\\frac{n}{\\log(1/1-\\alpha)}\\Big)$.\n   \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{proposition}\n\\begin{proof} For any \\(G(V,E)\\in \\Gn\\), let $P(G)\\{P_1,\\ldots,P_m\\}$ be the $m$ parts of the clique partition.\n\n\\emph{Case $\\alpha \\in (0,1).$}\nBy Observation \\ref{obs:grid_packing}(i) (take $nm$, $r1$ and $\\epsilon   \\alpha$), $m$ points can be embedded in (open) unit ball with interpoint distances at least $\\alpha$ in $\\ell_\\infty^d$ with $d\\big\\lceil \\frac{\\log m}{\\log\\lceil 1/\\alpha\\rceil} \\big\\rceil$. Thus, the mapping where vertices belonging to each partition $P_i$ of the input graph $G$ is mapped to the $i$-th point yields an $\\alpha$-preserving embedding in $\\ell_\\infty$, with (doubling) dimension at most $\\Big\\lceil\\log_2(3)\\Big\\lceil \\frac{ \\log |P(G)|}{\\log \\lceil 1/\\alpha\\rceil}\\Big\\rceil \\Big\\rceil\n O\\Big(\\frac{\\log |P(G)|}{\\log \\lceil 1/\\alpha\\rceil}\\Big)$.\n\n\\emph{Case $\\alpha \\in [1,2).$} Let $G / C(G)$ be the (simple) graph produced by contracting all nodes that are in the same part of $C(G)$ and preserving the edge connectivity. Since any $u,v \\in V$ with $N(v)N(u)$ (see Definition \\ref{def:CG}) can be embedded identically with no effect on $\\alpha$-preservation, an \\(\\alpha\\)-preservation of \\(G/C(G)\\) is an \\(\\alpha\\)-preservation of \\(G\\). Hence we re-apply Observation \\ref{prop:frechetEmbedding} to $G / C(G)$ to get the bound\\footnote{Note that this embedding works for \\(\\alpha\\in (0,2)\\), but since \\(|P(G)| \\leq |C(G)|\\) it offers no improvement.} $\\lceil \\log_2(3) \\cdot |C(G)| \\rceil$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIf we restrict to \\(\\ell_p\\) for \\(p<\\infty\\), we no longer have such a universal, isometric embedding to work with: instead, we have to pay some price in distortion, which in turn limits the \\(\\alpha\\)-separation we can achieve. It is tempting to think we can avoid paying that price by simply scaling up the separation between non-neighbors in the truncated shortest path metric, e.g. \\(\\rho(u,v)   \\log n\\) for \\(u\\not\\sim v\\). However, this is not an option because it would break with the triangle inequality. Therefore we are limited in our choice of \\(\\alpha\\). This is illustrated via the following upper bound in \\(\\ell_2\\), achieved using a standard spectral clustering approach. \nIt turns out that preservation of general graphs is easily done using standard techniques of spectral clustering.\n\\todo{rephrase; also unclear why prop 18 is needed, why not just state prop 20?}\n\n\n\\subsubsection{The \\(\\alpha < 1\\) case}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}   Note that \\(|\\Gnk| {n\\choose k}^n\\). It suffices\\end{proof}\n\nFor the $\\alpha < 1$ case, this upper bound improves considerably on Fr\u00e9chet-style embedding (Observation \\ref{prop:frechetEmbedding}) and nearly matches the general metric space lower bound given by Lemma \\ref{lem:preservation-hammer}. On the other hand, in the recoverable case, one cannot hope for more than a constant-factor improvement on this straightforward upper bound due to a result by \\citet{BoxicityRobert1969} who proved that there exist $G \\in \\Gn$ with $\\dim_{\\alpha \\geq 1}(G, \\ell_\\infty) \\geq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2}{3}|C(G)| \\right\\rfloor.$\n\n\\subsubsection{Preservation in Euclidean Space ($\\ell_2$)}\n\nTheorem \\ref{thm:polyMain}(ii) establishes a formidable \\(\\Omega(n)\\) lower bound on \\(\\ell_2\\) recoverability for most \\(G\\in \\Gn\\).

In contrast, the recoverability case exhibits an interesting phase shift. For \\(\\alpha\\) up to a graph-dependent threshold, the graph is recoverable in dimension depending on its spectrum. However, past this threshold, \\(\\alpha\\)-preservation is not always possible. In particular: The complete bipartite graph provides the hard instance.\n\n\\textcolor{red}{update: to get rid of annoying constant, Slight of notation: just multipy by \\(\\log_2 5 \\) to get the doubling dimension bound.}\n\n\\begin{restatable}{proposition}{chiGBasedUpperBound}\n\\label{prop:chiGBasedUpperBound}\nFor all \\(G\\in \\Gn\\), we have\n such that each vertex has degree at least \\(1\\),\\todo{Should be able to remove this assumption WLOG by embedding all points with degree less than 1 at some far away distance.}\n   $$\n   \\dim_\\alpha(G,\\ell_2) \\leq \n   \\left\\{\n   \\begin{array}{ll}\n   \\Big\\lceil\\log_2(5) \\Big\\lceil \\frac{ 4 \\log (|P(G)|+1)}{2-4\\alpha^2}\\Big\\rceil \\Big\\rceil\n   & \\alpha\\in(0,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})   \\vspace{0.05in} \\\\ \n\n   \\Big\\lceil\\log_2(5) \\Big\\lceil 12 \\big( \\frac{1+\\alpha^2}{1-\\alpha^2}\\big)^2 \\log |P(G)\\Big\\rceil \\Big\\rceil& \\alpha\\in \\big( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}},1 \\big)   \\vspace{0.05in} \\\\ \n\n   \\Big\\lceil\\log_2(5) \\cdot \\min\\big( \\lceil 192\\lambda_G^2 \\log|C(G)| \\rceil ,   \\   |C(G)|-1 \\big) \\Big\\rceil   & \\alpha\\in \\Big[1,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{4\\lambda_G}\n   \\min(1,\\frac{1}{4\\lambda_G})\n   }} \\Big)   \\vspace{0.05in} \\\\ \n\\lambda_G^2 \\log(n) & \\alpha\\in \\Big[1,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_G}}}\\Big)\n   \n   \\end{array}\n   \\right. ,\n   $$\n   \n\\todo{need to resolve the case of G having no edges - third case needs a +1!}\nwhere \\(\\lambda_G\\) denotes the maximum eigenvalue of \\(A(G / C(G))\\). \\todo{Should this not be the max eigenvalue of $G/C(G)$?}.\n\nMoreover, for all \\(n\\geq   4\\) there exists \\(G\\in \\Gn\\) which cannot be \\(\\alpha\\)-preserved in \\(\\ell_2\\) for \\(\\alpha > (1   - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_G})^{-1/2}\\).\n\\end{restatable}\n\nWe can view \\(\\lambda_G\\) as a proxy for the intrinsic complexity of the input graph.
