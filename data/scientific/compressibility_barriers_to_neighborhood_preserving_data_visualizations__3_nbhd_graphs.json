We improve upon our previous bounds based on the combinatorial properties of the neighbor graph by deriving bounds based on the geometric structure of the data creating the graph. \n\nWe now study the embeddability of graphs which reflect some sort of practical data-generating model.   with some notion of intrinsic structure. \nWe first study geometric graphs generated by points from a low dimensional metric space. We find that the choice of \\(\\alpha\\) drastically affects the difficulty of the problem: for \\(\\alpha\\) too large, the \\(\\alpha\\)-preservation dimension depends on the number of points rather than the intrinsic dimension. Next, we study graphs with planted cluster structure. If \\(k\\) is the number of clusters, we can interpolate the difficulty of \\(\\alpha\\)-preservation between \\(\\log k\\) to \\(\\log n\\) depending on the rates of inter- and intra-cluster connectivity. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Neighborhood Preservability of Clustered Data}\n\nMost data visualization algorithms seek to visualize clusters in a dataset. Ideally, such algorithms will be able to detect and represent the latent cluster structure in a constant-dimensional metric space. We show, for a general model of clustering, this is impossible, even when the clusters are well-separated. The standard graph-based model for clusters is the \\emph{planted partition model}:\n\n\\begin{definition}\\label{def:pp_model}\n   Fix integers \\(n\\geq k \\geq 1\\). For a partition $\\{S_1, \\ldots, S_k\\}$ of $V$ (of size $n$) and $0 \\leq q \\leq p \\leq 1$, define the planted partition distribution, $\\PP_{p,q}(S_1,\\ldots,S_k)$, as the distribution over $\\Gn(V)$ such that for all $i,j \\in [k]$ distinct, edges within $S_i$ occur independently with probability $p$ and edges between $S_i$ and $S_j$ occur independently with probability $q$.\\todo{want exact p and q or at least p and at most q?}\n\\end{definition}\n\n\nThe key parameters \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) capture intra- and inter-cluster connectivity. Naturally, the higher the gap between these two parameters, the more salient the cluster structure of the model. We provide a lower bound on the \\(\\alpha\\)-preservation dimension with respect to these parameters.   of a graph sampled from a planted partition model which depends on this gap.   \\(G\\) sampled which depends on their difference. \n\nWe show that if $0<q\\leq p<1$, then as the number of points grows \\todo{n sufficiently large}, almost surely, \ngraphs sampled from the planted part model will require $\\Theta(\\log n)$ dimensions to preserve. Meanwhile, if \\(q < p 1\\), then the preservation dimension relaxes to \\(\\Theta(\\log k)\\). We provide a lower bound which interpolates between these two regimes.\n\n\\begin{restatable}{theorem}\n{plantedPartition}\n\\label{thm:planted_partition}\n   Fix $ n \\geq k\\geq 1$ and let $\\{S_1, \\ldots, S_k\\}$ be a partition of $V$ (of size $n$). Let $c\\geq1$ be such that ${\\max_{i\\in[k]} |S_i| \\leq \\frac{cn}{k}}$, and   $0 < q \\leq p \\leq 1$ with $q<1$. Then for all $\\alpha \\in (0,2)$ with probability at least ${1-\\exp(-\\Omega(n^{\\min(2(p+q-pq),1)}))}$ over $G \\sim \\PP_{p,q}(S_1,\\ldots,S_k)$:\n   \\begin{equation*}\n   \\label{eq:planted_partition}\n   \\dim_\\alpha(G) \\geq \\frac{1}{\\log\\left(8/\\alpha\\right)}\\Big( (1-\\xi_{p,q}) \\log n + \\xi_{p,q} \\log(k/2c)   \\Big), + \\indicate[\\alpha > 1] \\cdot \\frac{\\log(n)}{\\log(\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1})},\n   \\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\xi_{p,q} :p-q+pq$ encodes the \\emph{cluster saliency} of the planted partition model. \n   $$\\dim_\\alpha(G) \\geq \\frac{1}{\\log\\left(8/\\alpha\\right)}\\log\\left(\\frac{n}{(3cn/k)^{p+q-pq}}\\right) .$$\n   where the probability is the over choice of $G$.\n\\end{restatable}\n\nThe proof proceeds by estimating clique number and the diameter of typical graphs generated from a planted partition model and applying our key Lemma \\ref{lem:preservation-hammer}. Formal details are provided in Appendix \\ref{app:cluster}.\n\n\n\\newpage\n\\pagebreak\n\nWe can think about this result as interpolating between two extremes:\n\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n   \\item \\textit{Perfectly clustered data.} When $p 1$ and $q   0$, we can trivially embed the graph in $1$ dimension.   Equation (\\ref{eq:planted_partition})\n   the lower bound becomes $\\Omega(\\log(k) / \\log(8/\\alpha))$.   $$\\dim_\\alpha(G) \\geq \\Omega\\Big(\\frac{\\log(k)}{\\log\\left(8/\\alpha\\right)}\\Big).$$\n   This this matches our upper bound in Proposition \\ref{prop:nontrivial_PG_ub} for \\(\\alpha\\leq 1\\), since \\(|P(G)|   k\\).\n\\item \\textit{Clustered data}. When \\(0 < q < p   1\\) (with \\(q\\) constant), we have \\(\\xi_{p,q}1\\), so the lower bound becomes $\\Omega(\\frac{\\log(k/3c))}{ \\log(8/\\alpha)})$. This essentially matches our upper bound in Proposition \\ref{prop:nontrivial_PG_ub} for \\(\\alpha\\leq 1\\), since \\(|P(G)|   k\\).\n   \\item \\textit{Unclustered data.} When $pq\\frac{1}{2}$, the lower bound   becomes \\(\\Omega(\\frac{(3/4) \\log n + (1/4) \\log(k/3c)}{\\log(8/\\alpha)})   \\Omega(\\frac{\\log(n)}{ \\log(8/\\alpha)})\\), which matches the upper bound in   Proposition \\ref{prop:nontrivial_PG_ub}. \n\\end{itemize}\nNote that the transition between the \\(\\log n\\) and \\(\\log k\\) regimes is very abrupt and depends on \\(p<1\\) versus \\(\\)\n\n\n\n\\input{CLUSTER_PROOF}\n\nSince \\(G\\sim \\PP_{p,q}(S_1,...,S_k)\\) is typically of constant diameter, the lower bound shown above is tight for \\(\\alpha \\leq 1\\) per Corollary \\ref{cor:gn_diam2}. \nFor \\(\\alpha > 1\\), we have a stronger lower bound: even when \\(p1\\) (the fully connected clusters case), the \\(\\alpha\\)-preservation dimension is \\(\\Omega(\\log n)\\) with overwhelming probability.   We provide the proof in the appendix. In other words, there is a big price to increasing the gap between the neighbor and non-neighbors thresholds.\n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{prop:clusters_alpha_geq_1}\n   Fix any $\\alpha > 1$. Pick $p1$ and $0<q<1$. Then if \\(\\max_{i\\in [k]}|S_i| \\leq c n/k\\), \\(G\\sim \\PP_{p,q}(S_1,...,S_k)\\) with probability at least $1 - n^2\\left(\\max(q,1-q)^{2n(1-c/k)}+e^{-q^2(n-1)}\\right)$, we have $\\dim_{\\alpha}(G) \\geq \\frac{\\log(n)}{\\log(\\frac{8}{\\alpha - 1})}.$\n\\end{proposition}\n\n\nThis is a very general model which is realized geometrically by mixture distributions, e.g.\\ a mixture of Gaussians.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nLet \\(F_1,...,F_k\\) be distributions in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\).
