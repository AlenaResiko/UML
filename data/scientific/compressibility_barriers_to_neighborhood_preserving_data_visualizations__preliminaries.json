This is because, aside from some very trivial cases, all graphs simply do not admit $(\\alpha \\geq 2)$-preservation. In particular:\n\n\\begin{proposition}\n\\label{prop:alpha_gt_2}\n   Let $\\alpha \\geq 2$. For all $G \\in \\Gn$, either (i) $\\dim_\\alpha(G)$ is undefined (i.e.\\ $\\alpha$-preservation is not possible), or (ii) all connected components in $G$ are cliques and \\(G\\) can be \\(\\alpha\\)-preserved in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\\end{proposition}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n   Suppose $G(V,E) \\in \\Gn$ contains a connected component that is not a clique. We will show $G$ is not $(\\alpha \\geq 2)$-preservable in any metric space. Let $V'\\subseteq V$ be the non-clique connected component of $G$. The diameter of $G|_{V'}$ is at least $2$. Thus there exist two vertices $u,v \\in V'$ such that the shortest path between them is of length exactly $2$. Let $w$ be the ``connecting'' vertex such that $u \\sim w \\sim v$, and assume towards contradiction there exists an algorithm $f$ that $\\alpha$-preserves $G$ in some metric space $\\X$ (with neighborhood threshold of $r>0$, see Definition \\ref{def:preserve}). Then the maximum distance between $u$ and $v$ in the embedding is:\n   $$\\rho(f_G(u), f_G(v)) \\leq \\rho(f_G(u),f_G(w)) + \\rho(f_G(w),f_G(v)) < 2 r,$$\n   which implies that $u \\sim v$ since $\\alpha \\geq 2$ implies $u \\not \\sim v \\implies \\rho(f_G(u), f_G(v)) \\geq r \\cdot \\alpha \\geq 2r $. This contradicts the fact that the shortest path between $u$ and $v$ is of length 2. Thus, an $f$ that $\\alpha$-preserves $G$ cannot exist.\n\n   Suppose all connected components of \\(G\\) are cliques. Observe that any visualization algorithm $f: \\Gn \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that maps each clique to a unique point \n   \\todo{technically not a metric but a pseudometric. Szy: Is the metric defined over $\\mathbb{R}$ not valid? Note embedding does not need to be injective} \n   in $\\mathbb{R}$ $\\alpha$-preserves these graphs for all $\\alpha > 0$, in particular \\(\\alpha \\geq 2\\) (simply choose $r>0$ small enough). \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{remark}\n   If \\(\\alpha \\in (0,2)\\), then for all \\(G\\in \\Gn\\), \\(\\dim_\\alpha(G) < \\infty\\), because the shortest path metric on the graph induces an \\((\\alpha < 2)\\)-preservation.\n\\end{remark}\n\\textcolor{blue}{The following lemma will be useful for establishing weak lower bounds on the doubling dimension of metric spaces we construct. \\begin{lemma}\\label{lem.aspectratio}Suppose \\((\\X,\\rho)\\) is a metric space with doubling dimension \\(m\\) and aspect ratio \\(\\Delta\\). Then \\(|X| \\leq \\Delta^{O(m)}\\).\\end{lemma}}\n\n\\subsection{Monotonicity Properties of \\(\\alpha\\)-Preservation Dimension}\n\n\\iffalse\n\\begin{observation}\\label{obs:DistortionImpliesPreservation}\n   For $\\alpha \\leq 1$. If $f$ constitutes an $\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$-distortion embedding\\footnote{Note that $(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} < 1)$-embedding is impossible by definition.} of $G$ equipped with shortest path metric, then $f$ $\\alpha$-preserves $G$. \\todo{fix writing}\n\\end{observation}\n\\fi\n\n\nWe also observe the following intuitive monotonicity properties of \\(\\alpha\\)-preservation. \n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{prop:monotonicity}For \\(G\\in \\Gn\\) and a collection of metric spaces \\(\\mathbb{X}\\), assume \\(\\dim_\\alpha(G,\\X)\\) is well-defined. The visualization dimension satisfies the following properties:\n\\begin{itemize}\n   \\item[(i)] If \\(\\beta \\leq \\alpha\\) then \\(\\dim_\\beta(G,\\mathbb{X}) \\leq \\dim_\\alpha(G,\\mathbb{X})\\).\n   \\item[(ii)] If \\(\\mathbb{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Y}\\) then \\(\\dim_\\alpha(G,\\mathbb{Y}) \\leq \\dim_\\alpha(G,\\mathbb{X})\\).\n   \\item[(iii)] For all \\(V_1\\sqcup ...\\sqcup V_k V\\), \\(\\dim_\\alpha(G)   \\)\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{proposition}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet \\(K_{S,\\X,\\alpha}   \\{\\X: \\exists f:\\Gn\\to \\X^n \\text{ which \\(\\alpha\\)-preserves \\(S\\)}\\}\\).\n   For (i), note that if \\(f\\) \\(\\alpha\\)-preserves \\(S\\), then it necessarily \\(\\beta\\)-preserves \\(S\\). So the set of \\(\\beta\\)-preserving embeddings is larger, therefore an infimum over this larger set is only smaller.\n\n   For (ii), note if \\(f\\) \\(\\alpha\\)-preserves \\(S\\), then it necessarily \\(\\alpha\\)-preserves \\(T\\).   So the set of embeddings which \\(\\alpha\\)-preserves \\(T\\) is only larger, therefore an infimum over this larger set is only smaller.\n\n   For (iii), note if there exists \\(\\X\\in \\mathbb{X}\\) where \\(f\\) maps into \\(\\X\\) and \\(\\alpha\\)-preseves \\(S\\), then there exists \\(\\X\\in \\mathbb{Y}\\) where \\(f\\) maps into \\(\\X\\) and \\(\\alpha\\)-preseves \\(S\\).   So the set of embeddings which \\(\\alpha\\)-preserves \\(S\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Y}\\) is only larger, there an infimum over this larger set is only smaller.\n   \\end{proof}\n\n\nThroughout the rest of the paper we shall assume $\\alpha\\in(0,2)$.",
