def save_tex_file(raw_text: str, base_name: str = "paper", strict_unescape: bool = False):
    """
    Save a raw LaTeX text string as a .tex file in the scratch directory,
    ensuring that literal '\\n' characters are treated as newlines **without**
    corrupting LaTeX control sequences like ``\newcommand``/``\newtheorem``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    raw_text : str
        The LaTeX text content, possibly containing literal '\\n' sequences.
    base_name : str
        The base name for the file (without extension). Defaults to 'paper'.
    strict_unescape : bool
        If True, aggressively replace *all* literal "\\n" with real newlines.
        Default False (safe mode): only unescape when "\\n" is **not** starting
        a LaTeX control word (i.e., not followed by a letter).

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The full path to the saved .tex file.

    Notes
    -----
    - The naive replacement of all "\\n" â†’ "\\n" breaks LaTeX commands like
      \newcommand or \newtheorem, which must remain as literal backslash + n.
    - This function only replaces "\\n" when it is *not* followed by a letter,
      leaving LaTeX commands untouched. See comments below for details.
    - If strict_unescape=True, all "\\n" are replaced, for trusted JSON input.
